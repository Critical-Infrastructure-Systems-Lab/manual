## About the CIS Lab

As mentioned on the [CIS Lab Website](https://galelli.cee.cornell.edu), **we are** a team of scientists and engineers working on the interaction between critical infrastructures and the natural environment. **We characterize** climate risk on interconnected infrastructure systems and provide adaptive, robust, and scalable management solutions that balance reliability, resilience, and sustainability. **We combine** and leverage elements of process-based modelling, climatology, statistical learning, control theory, and optimization. Our group was established in 2013 by Dr. Stefano Galelli, when he joined the Singapore University of Technology and Design. We recently moved to Cornell University, so we now have roots in both North America and Southeast Asia.

## Our values

There are a few important values on which our team builds. In particular, we believe in:

- A respectful, constructive, and pleasant working environment, in which everybody feels welcome and nurtured.

- Academic work-life balance. All stages of academic life can be challenging; we follow [these rules](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282063/) to guide us through our daily life. 

- Science, engineering, and research as a means to improve the quality of life on this planet--as well as our knowledge.

- [Slow Science](https://compsci.science/slowscience), an expression intended to emphasize the need for solid and needed research, as opposed to sloppy and incremental work needed to increase somebody's H-index. If you want to know more about this, check ["Science in the age of selfies"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1609793113) by Donald and Stuart Geman. 

- Open-source software. 

- Reproducible research.

## Your 'digital' identity as a scientist

At first sight, this may appear ackward, but we can now have a digital identity: it is called [ORCID](https://orcid.org), which stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID. ORCID is now required by most journals, scientific associations, and funding agencies, so please **create an account and obtain your Open Researcher and Contributor ID**. It is free.

## Our community

There are a few scientific organizations we engage with:

- [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org), as well as the [European Geosciences Union](https://www.egu.eu) and [Asia Oceania Geosciences Society](https://www.asiaoceania.org/society/public.asp?page=home.asp). These organizations are our 'home' for all aspects of our research (e.g., conferences, publications) pertaining to water and climate.

- [international Environmental Modelling & Software Society](https://iemss.org), which publishes [Environmental Modelling & Software](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-modelling-and-software) (and organizes a biennial conference).

- [MultiSector Dynamics](https://multisectordynamics.org), a new community of practice studying the co-evolution of human and natural systems over time. We contribute to this community through the Working Group on [AI4MSD](https://multisectordynamics.org/using-ai-to-enhance-msd-research/).

- [American Society of Civil Engineers](https://www.asce.org), which was established in 1852! Its journals of hydrology and water management are relevant to our work.

- [Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences](https://www.informs.org). The Annual Meeting of INFORMS always features several talks on energy systems that are relevant to our work.

- [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](https://www.openmod-initiative.org) is a community facilitating the exchange of data and models for macro-scale energy systems.

## To do list

- Please familiarize with our values. Naturally, feel free to discuss about them! The point of having a collaborative blog is that we can work on this together.
- Open an account on [ORCID](https://orcid.org).
- Read about the scientific organizations described above and think about which one(s) is closer to your work and interests. Consider signing up for at least one; annual fees for Graduate students tend to be affordable.
