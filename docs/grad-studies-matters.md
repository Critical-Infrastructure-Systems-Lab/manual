# Courses

What courses are offered by Cornell's CEE School? How about other departments? All information about courses, enrollment etc. are provided on the [website](https://registrar.cornell.edu) of the Cornell University Registrar. An additional resources we recommend checking out is the EWRS [class-list](https://github.com/Cornell-EWRS/class-list), which contains reviews of courses taken by former EWRS students. Ask [Stefano](mailto;galelli@cornell.edu) for the credentials to access the class-list.


# CEE Graduate Field handbook

Aside from courses, you will need information on requirements, deadlines, exams etc. This information is consolidated in the [CEE Graduate Field handbook](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/cee-graduate-field-handbook).

# Conferences

Which conferences should I attend? To answer this question, it is first important to think about your [community](https://critical-infrastructure-systems-lab.github.io/manual/about/), since every scientific community organizes conferences that may be relevant to you. This said, please find below a non-comprehensive list of conferences that CIS Lab members attend:

- [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting)
- [EGU General Assemply](https://www.egu.eu/meetings/general-assembly/)
- [iEMSs biennial conference](https://conference.iemss.org)
