# Courses

What courses are offered by Cornell's CEE School? How about other departments? All information about courses, enrollment etc. are provided on the [website](https://registrar.cornell.edu) of the Cornell University Registrar. An additional resources we recommend checking out is the EWRS [class-list](https://github.com/Cornell-EWRS/class-list), which contains reviews of courses taken by former EWRS students. Ask [Stefano](mailto;galelli@cornell.edu) for the credentials to access the class-list.

# CEE Graduate Field handbook

Aside from courses, you will need information on requirements, deadlines, exams etc. This information is consolidated in the [CEE Graduate Field handbook](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/cee-graduate-field-handbook).

# Conferences

Which conferences should I attend? To answer this question, it is first important to think about your [community](https://critical-infrastructure-systems-lab.github.io/manual/about/), since every scientific community organizes conferences that may be relevant to you. This said, please find below a non-comprehensive list of conferences that CIS Lab members attend:

- [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting)
- [EGU General Assemply](https://www.egu.eu/meetings/general-assembly/)
- [iEMSs biennial conference](https://conference.iemss.org)
- [EWRS](https://www.ewricongress.org)
- [INFORMS Annual Meeting](https://www.informs.org/Meetings-Conferences)

# Tools for Discovering and Mining Scientific Literature

Efficient literature discovery is essential for staying current and building a strong foundation for research. Several tools support academic exploration, citation mapping, and literature mining:

- **ResearchRabbit**: A visual discovery platform that lets you explore networks of related papers, co-authors, and research topics. Especially useful for identifying overlooked but relevant work.
  - Website: <https://www.researchrabbit.ai>

- **Connected Papers**: Generates a visual graph of papers related to a “seed” paper using co-citation and similarity metrics. Helpful for finding conceptual neighborhoods.
  - Website: <https://www.connectedpapers.com>

- **Litmaps**: Allows you to track and visualize how papers are connected over time. Useful for longitudinal research mapping.
  - Website: <https://www.litmaps.com>

- **Semantic Scholar**: Uses AI to extract key insights (e.g., methods, data sets) and ranks results by relevance. Includes citation influence metrics.
  - Website: <https://www.semanticscholar.org>

- **Lens.org**: A powerful tool for literature and patent search with exportable citation graphs and advanced filtering.
  - Website: <https://www.lens.org>

For automated mining, tools like `scholarly` (Python) and APIs from Crossref, OpenAlex, or Semantic Scholar can be used to build custom search pipelines or citation networks.
