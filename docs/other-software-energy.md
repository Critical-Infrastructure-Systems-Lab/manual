## GridPath: Power-System Planning Platform

**GridPath** is an open-source modeling framework for long-term power system planning and operational analysis. It supports capacity expansion, production cost modeling, and resource adequacy assessmentsâ€”all within a unified, modular architecture. Developed by [Blue Marble Analytics](https://www.bluemarble.run/gridpath) and maintained by [Sylvan Energy Analytics](https://www.gridpath.io/), GridPath is designed for flexibility. It accommodates a wide range of temporal and spatial resolutions, resource types (e.g., renewables, storage), and policy constraints (e.g., carbon caps, RPS). GridPath has been applied in various studies, including the [RA Toolkit](https://gridlab.org/gridpathratoolkit/) for resource adequacy in the Western U.S., which models load-resource interactions and energy-limited systems. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/blue-marble/gridpath), with documentation at [Read the Docs](https://gridpath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

In our lab, GridPath has been used for capacity expansion studies for the [South China Power Grid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01363-1) ([code](https://zenodo.org/records/8278149)) and [Southern Africa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243512200304X) ([code](https://zenodo.org/records/6662142)). For production cost studies, we used [PowNet](https://github.com/Critical-Infrastructure-Systems-Lab/PowNet).
